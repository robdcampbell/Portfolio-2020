            I'm currently a Systems Administrator in the MFA Computer Arts
            program at the School of Visual Arts (SVA), and I work as part of a
            small team to oversee the maintainance of lab machines and servers,
            as well as department's licensing of lab software.

          <ExperiencesP>
            My role as an Exhibition Coordinator routinely acted as an on-floor
            liaison between artists, curators, and other colleagues to ensure
            exhibitions and programs were realized within tight deadlines.

          <ExperiencesP>
            Our team had the opportunity to bring incredible thesis work of
            students from various undergraduate and graduate programs, as well
            as exhibit prominent practicing artists, curators, and designers
            such as Michael Bierut, Lousie Fili, Christoph Niemann, and many
            others.
